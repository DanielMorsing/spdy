a simple SPDY server.

In order to learn a bit about SPDY, I figured I'd try to implement it in go.
It is not really production ready and still missing some features, but it is possible to use it to
host a reverse proxy on a local godoc server. Use at your own risk.

For more information on how to use this package, refer to the godoc for this package.

TODO: receive windows, client certificate vectors, server push, better prioritization strategy.
